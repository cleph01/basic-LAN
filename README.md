### Project Overview

In this project, I build, configure, and troubleshoot a small network environment and gain hands-on, foundational practice on general IT, Networking, and Cybersecurity concepts.

It also reinforces digital sovereignty concepts by understanding how devices communicate at the hardware and packet level, not just through abstract cloud services.

### 📋 Setup Overview

- **Switch Setup:** Unmanaged Ethernet switch
- **Internet Gateway:** T-Mobile 5G cellular router
- **Host Device:** MacBook with Ethernet-to-USB-C adapter (Wi-Fi disabled)
- **Tools:** Crimping tool, cable tester, Wireshark

### ⚙️ Activities

- Cut, strip, and terminate custom Cat6 Ethernet cables

- Set up and test physical network connectivity through a switch

- Disable wireless interfaces to test pure wired connections

- Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark

- Observe ARP broadcasts and MAC address learning behavior in real time

- Confirm internet routing through cellular gateway

### 🧠 Key Learnings

- Mastering the physical layer (cabling) for reliable network setups
- Understanding basic switching operations (MAC address table formation)
- Identifying different network traffic types at the packet level

- Hands-on practice with Wireshark packet capture and analysis

### 🚀 Future Improvements

- Set up VLANs for segmented traffic
- Add a managed switch for advanced switching features
- Expand into monitoring DHCP, DNS, HTTP traffic for a full-stack lab experience
